This code sets up an Express.js server along with socket.io WebSocket support. Here are the main points explained:

An HTTP server is created using the http.createServer(app) method, where app is your Express.js app.

A socket.io server instance (io) is created using the Server class, and it's configured to allow connections from any origin (*) and 
specifies accepted HTTP methods.

Routes are imported for your application.

Middleware for body parsing, CORS, and serving static files is configured.

The server listens on the specified PORT.

Routes are added to the Express app.

This code combines your Express.js server and socket.io WebSocket server into a single application. It allows you to handle both HTTP 
and WebSocket connections within the same application, making it suitable for real-time features like chat.
