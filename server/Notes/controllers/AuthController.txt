registerUser: This function is used to register a new user. It hashes the user's password using bcrypt for security, checks if a user 
with the same username already exists, and then saves the new user to the database. It also generates a JWT token for authentication 
and responds with the newly registered user and the token.

loginUser: This function handles user login. It first finds a user with the provided username, checks if the provided password matches 
the stored hashed password using bcrypt.compare, and then generates a JWT token if the login is successful. It responds with the 
authenticated user and the token. If the username or password is incorrect, it responds with an appropriate error message.

Both functions provide authentication using JWT tokens and handle various error scenarios appropriately.
