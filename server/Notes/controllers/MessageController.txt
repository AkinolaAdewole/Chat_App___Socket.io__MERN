1.
addMessage: This function is used to add a new message to a chat. It extracts the chatId, senderId, and text from the request body and 
creates a new message instance with these values. Then, it attempts to save the new message to the database using message.save(). 
If successful, it responds with the saved message as a JSON response. If there's an error during the process, 
it sends a 500 (Internal Server Error) response with the error details.

2.
getMessages: This function is used to retrieve messages for a specific chat. It extracts the chatId from the request parameters and 
queries the database to find all messages that belong to the specified chatId using MessageModel.find(). It responds with the retrieved 
messages as a JSON response. If there's an error during the database query, it sends a 500 (Internal Server Error) response with the 
error details.

These functions allow you to interact with message data in the database, enabling the addition of new messages to a chat and the 
retrieval of messages for a specific chat.
