It imports the jsonwebtoken library for JWT handling and the dotenv library to load environment variables.

It retrieves the JWT secret key from the environment variables using process.env.JWTKEY.

The authMiddleWare function is defined as an asynchronous middleware that takes req, res, and next as parameters. 
req represents the incoming request, res is the response object and next is a callback function to pass control to the next 
middleware or route handler.

Inside the try block, it attempts to extract the JWT token from the "Authorization" header of the incoming request. 
The header typically looks like "Bearer <token>", so it splits the header string to get the actual token.

If a token is found, it attempts to verify the token's authenticity using the jwt.verify method, passing in the token and 
the secret key.

If the token is successfully verified, it extracts the user ID (decoded.id) from the token and attaches it to the 
request body as _id. This allows other middleware or route handlers downstream to access the user's ID for further processing.

Finally, it calls the next() function to pass control to the next middleware or route handler in the request processing pipeline.

Note: If an error occurs during token verification or if there's no token in the request, the error is caught and logged to the console.


This middleware is designed to check the authorization header of incoming requests for a valid JWT, verify it and 
provide the user's ID to subsequent handlers if the JWT is valid. It can be used to protect routes that require 
authentication in your application.
