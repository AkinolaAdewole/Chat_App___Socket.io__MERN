1.
updateUser: This action creator is used to update a user's information. 
It dispatches an action of type "UPDATING_START" to indicate the start of the updating process. 
It then makes an API request using UserApi.updateUser(id, formData) to send the updated user data to the server. 
If the request is successful, it dispatches an action of type "UPDATING_SUCCESS" with the updated data. 
If there's an error, it dispatches an action of type "UPDATING_FAIL" to handle the failure.

2.
followUser: This action creator is used to follow another user. 
It dispatches an action of type "FOLLOW_USER" to indicate that the user is following the specified user. 
It then makes an API request using UserApi.followUser(id, data) to follow the user. This action creator doesn't handle success or 
failure explicitly but triggers the API call.

3.
unfollowUser: This action creator is used to unfollow another user. 
It dispatches an action of type "UNFOLLOW_USER" to indicate that the user is unfollowing the specified user. 
It then makes an API request using UserApi.unfollowUser(id, data) to unfollow the user. Like the previous action, 
this one also doesn't handle success or failure explicitly but triggers the API call.

These action creators encapsulate the logic for making API requests and dispatching Redux actions to update the application state 
based on the results of these requests. The exact behavior of the reducers that handle these actions will determine how the state 
changes in response to these actions.
