This code defines a React component called RightSide.
The component manages the state of a modalOpened variable using the useState hook to control the visibility of the share modal.
Inside the return statement, the component renders the following:
A side navbar (NavIcons) component.
A TrendCard component.
A "Share" button with an onClick event that toggles the modalOpened state to true, opening the share modal when clicked.
A ShareModal component that is conditionally rendered based on the modalOpened state. This modal allows users to share content.
The component's structure suggests it is part of a larger user interface, providing quick access to navigation icons, trending
 content, and sharing functionality.
