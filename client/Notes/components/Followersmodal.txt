his code defines a React component called FollowersModal.
The component uses the Mantine library's Modal component to create a modal for displaying followers.
It receives two props: modalOpened (a boolean that controls the visibility of the modal) and 
setModalOpened (a function to update the modalOpened state).
The useMantineTheme hook is used to access the current theme from Mantine.
Inside the Modal component:
overlayColor, overlayOpacity, and overlayBlur are set based on the theme to control the appearance of the modal overlay.
size determines the width of the modal.
opened is controlled by the modalOpened prop, determining whether the modal is open or closed.
onClose is set to setModalOpened(false), allowing the modal to be closed when clicked.
Within the Modal component, it renders the FollowersCard component with the location prop set to "modal," indicating that it's being 
rendered within the modal for a specific context.
