It imports various libraries and components, including icons, modals, Redux hooks, and API functions.

Inside the component function, it initializes state variables using the useState hook for managing the 
modal state (modalOpened) and storing the profile user's data (profileUser).

It uses the useParams hook from React Router to extract the id parameter from the URL, representing the user profile being viewed.

It fetches the authenticated user's data from the Redux store using the useSelector hook.

There's a handleLogOut function that dispatches a Redux action (logout) when the "Log Out" button is clicked.

Inside the useEffect hook, it fetches the profile user's data from the API when the component mounts. If the profile being viewed is 
the authenticated user's own profile, it uses the user data from the Redux store (user). If viewing another user's profile, 
it fetches their data using the UserApi.getUser function.

The component then renders the profile information, including the profile edit icon (if viewing the authenticated user's own profile), 
status, location, workplace, and a "Log Out" button.

When the edit icon is clicked, it opens a profile edit modal (ProfileModal) with the user's data pre-filled for editing.

Overall, this component is responsible for displaying profile information, handling profile editing for the authenticated user, and 
providing a "Log Out" button for logging out of the application.
