This code defines a React component called FollowersCard.
The component manages the state of modalOpened, which controls the visibility of a followers modal, and persons, 
which stores a list of users.
The useSelector hook is used to access the user data from the Redux store.
Inside the useEffect hook, an API request is made to fetch a list of users (persons) and populate the persons state when 
the component mounts.
The component renders a list of users as User components, excluding the current user.
It also renders a "Show more" link if the location prop is not provided, allowing users to open the followers modal.
The FollowersModal component is conditionally rendered based on the modalOpened state, allowing users to view more followers 
when the modal is open.
