It manages the state related to posts, including the posts array, loading indicators (loading and uploading), and error states (error).

When the post upload process starts ("UPLOAD_START"), it sets uploading to true and clears the error state.

When a post upload is successful ("UPLOAD_SUCCESS"), it adds the new post to the beginning of the posts array, clears uploading, 
and clears the error state.

When a post upload fails ("UPLOAD_FAIL"), it sets uploading to false and sets error to true.

When the process of retrieving posts starts ("RETREIVING_START"), it sets loading to true and clears the error state.

When retrieving posts is successful ("RETREIVING_SUCCESS"), it replaces the current posts array with the received posts data, clears 
loading, and clears the error state.

When retrieving posts fails ("RETREIVING_FAIL"), it sets loading to false and sets error to true.

This reducer is responsible for managing post-related actions, updating the state accordingly, and handling post uploading and retrieval.
