It manages the state related to user authentication (authData), loading indicators (loading and updateLoading), 
and error states (error).

When the authentication process starts ("AUTH_START"), it sets loading to true and clears the error state.

When authentication is successful ("AUTH_SUCCESS"), it saves the user's data to local storage, updates authData, and clears 
loading and error states.

When authentication fails ("AUTH_FAIL"), it sets loading to false and sets error to true.

When a profile update starts ("UPDATING_START"), it sets updateLoading to true and clears the error state.

When a profile update is successful ("UPDATING_SUCCESS"), it saves the updated user data to local storage, updates authData, and 
clears updateLoading and error states.

When a profile update fails ("UPDATING_FAIL"), it sets updateLoading to false and sets error to true.

When the user logs out ("LOG_OUT"), it clears local storage and resets the state to its initial values.

When the user follows another user ("FOLLOW_USER"), it updates the following list in the user's data.

When the user unfollows another user ("UNFOLLOW_USER"), it updates the following list in the user's data by removing the unfollowed user.

This reducer is responsible for managing user authentication and profile-related actions, updating the state accordingly.
