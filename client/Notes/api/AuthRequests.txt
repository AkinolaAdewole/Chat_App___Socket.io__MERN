import axios from 'axios';: Import the Axios library, which is a popular JavaScript library for making HTTP requests from the browser 
or Node.js.

const API = axios.create({ baseURL: 'http://localhost:5000' });: Create an Axios instance named API with a specified base URL. 
The base URL is set to 'http://localhost:5000', which means that all requests made using this instance will be 
relative to this base URL. In this case, it's configured to communicate with a backend server running locally on port 5000. 
You can change this base URL to the appropriate server address for your application.

export const logIn = (formData) => API.post('/auth/login', formData);: Export a function named logIn that takes a formData object as 
an argument. This function uses the Axios instance API to send a POST request to the '/auth/login' endpoint on the server. 
The formData object likely contains user credentials (e.g., username and password) for the login process.

export const signUp = (formData) => API.post('/auth/register', formData);: Export a function named signUp that also takes a formData 
object as an argument. This function uses the same Axios instance API to send a POST request to the '/auth/register' endpoint on the 
server. The formData object likely contains user registration data (e.g., username, password, email) for the signup process.

By creating an Axios instance with a base URL and defining these functions, you've encapsulated the configuration for making API 
requests to your backend server. This separation of concerns allows you to easily switch between 
different base URLs (e.g., for development, staging, or production environments) and reuse these functions throughout your application 
to interact with your backend API.
