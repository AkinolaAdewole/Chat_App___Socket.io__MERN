Import necessary Redux functions and libraries, including createStore, applyMiddleware, and compose.

Import the Redux Thunk middleware, which allows you to dispatch asynchronous actions in Redux.

Import the Redux reducers from your project's reducers file.

Define a function saveToLocalStorage(store) that serializes the Redux store and saves it to local storage.

Define a function loadFromLocalStorage() that retrieves and parses the Redux state from local storage.

Define the composeEnhancers variable, which is set to the Redux DevTools extension's compose function if available, 
or the default compose function if not.

Load the persisted state from local storage using the loadFromLocalStorage() function.

Create the Redux store using createStore, passing in the reducers, persisted state, and middleware (Thunk) with the Redux DevTools 
extension composed enhancer.

Subscribe to changes in the Redux store using store.subscribe(). When the state changes, it calls saveToLocalStorage() to save the 
updated state to local storage.

Finally, export the configured Redux store for use in your application.

This code sets up a Redux store with the ability to persist state in local storage and load it when the application starts. 
It also integrates Redux Thunk middleware for handling asynchronous actions and Redux DevTools for debugging.
